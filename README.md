# Express TypeScript Template

This project is a ready-to-use template for setting up a robust Express.js application using TypeScript. It's packed with several technologies to ensure a smooth and efficient development experience.

## Technologies

- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript and adds static types, making the code easier to understand and less prone to runtime errors.

- **ESLint**: A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. Use `npm run lint:fix` to run ESLint and automatically fix problems.

- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules. Use `npm run format:fix` to run Prettier and automatically format your code.

- **Husky**: A tool to enforce code quality using pre-commit and pre-push hooks. Husky is set up to run ESLint and Prettier on your TypeScript files when you commit changes.

- **Git**: A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

- **Logger**: A tool for logging information, which is very useful for understanding the flow of the application when debugging.

- **Error Handling**: A mechanism to handle runtime errors and ensure the application continues to run smoothly.

- **Jest**: A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It works with projects using Babel, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Angular, Vue.js and more!
